A mosquito once cried out in pain,
"A chemist has poisoned my brain!"
The cause of his sorrow
Was para-dichloro
diphenyltrichloroethane.

A limerick packs laughs anatomical
Into space that is quite economical
But the good ones I've seen
So seldom are clean
And the clean ones so seldom are comical

There once was a fellow from Perth
who was born on the day of his birth
He was married, they say
on his wife’s wedding day
and he died on his last day on Earth

There once was an artist named Saint
Who swallowed a pallete of paint
All shades of the spectrum
Flowed out of his rectum
With a colourful lack of restraint.

On the chest of a barmaid in Sale
Was tattooed the prices of ale
And on her behind
For the sake of the blind
Was the same information in braille

There once was a young man from Kent
Who's dick was so long it was bent
To stay out of trouble
He bent it back double
So instead of coming he went

If you catch a chinchilla in Chile
And cut off its beard, willy-nilly
You can honestly say
You made on that day
A Chilean chinchilla's chin chilly

A dozen a gross and a score
Plus three times the square root of four
Divided by seven
Add five times eleven
Is nine squared and not a bit more

I once took a shit in this stall
So thick and so firm it stood tall
It stood high on end, 
that shit did not bend
But fell over and scraped my left ball.

An Argentine gaucho named Bruno
Said “Humping is one thing I do know.
A woman is fine,
and a sheep is divine:
but a llama is ‘numero uno'”.

There was a young lady from Exeter,
So pretty that men craned their necks at her.
One was even so brave
As to take out and wave
The distinguishing mark of his sex at her.

God’s plan made a hopeful beginning.
But man spoiled his chances by sinning.
We trust that the story
Will end in God’s glory,
But at present the other side’s winning.

There was a young lady from Rye
Who ate some green apples and died
The apples fermented
Inside the lamented
And made cider inside 'er inside.

There was a young pirate from Bristol
Whose cutlass was made out of crystal.
Other pirates just laughed,
they all thought him daft.
But they learned he was good with a pistol.
